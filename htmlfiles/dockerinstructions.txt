When trying to run the code in the docker container, must do these commands in your terminal to run (I used VSCode to run these commands and access the website)
1. docker pull admc1337/edustock:latest
2. docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name edustock_website admc1337/edustock:latest
3. Enter this into your web browser when running the container: http://localhost:8000
Must have it running in Docker to access
